SharpGL supports almost all extensions and the core functionality of OpenGL to version 4.2. If you are unsure of whether an extension is supported, check here. If you find that an extension you need is not supported, please fork and add it or raise an issue.

## Core Functionality

All OpenGL Core Functionality is fully implemented up to and including: **OpenGL 4.2**

OpenGL Functions from 1.2 to 1.5 (inclusive) which have been deprecated in the standard are available to use, but marked as Obsolete - meaning that their usage will generate warnings.

## Extensions
